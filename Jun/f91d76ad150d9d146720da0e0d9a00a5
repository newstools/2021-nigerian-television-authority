The Federal Government has approved the extension of the deadline for NIN-SIM data verification to July 26, 2021.  The decision to extend the deadline was made after a request by stakeholders on the need to consolidate the enrolment and NIN-SIM verification process following the rapid increase in the number of enrolment systems across the country. As of June 28, 2021, a total of 5,410 enrolment systems are now available across the country and this would significantly ease the NIN enrolment process and subsequent linkage of NIN to SIM cards. It is worthy of note that there were only about 800 such enrolment systems as of December 2020. The Federal Government has approved the extension as part of its effort to make it easier for its citizens and residents to obtain the NIN and it is important to take advantage of the extension. There are 57.3 million unique NIN enrolments, with an average of 3 to 4 SIMs per NIN.  With the great number of enrolment centres across the country, every citizen and legal resident should be able to obtain their NINs. The Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, on behalf of the Federal Government, appreciate Nigerians for their patience and compliance with the Federal Governmentâ€™s directive on the NIN-SIM registration exercise. The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Dambatta, and the Director-General/CEO of the National Identity Management Commission, Dr Aliyu Azeez, urge citizens and legal residents to make sure they use the opportunity to complete the process of enrolment and verification.
