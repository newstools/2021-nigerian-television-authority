Senate has passed the bill seeking to amend the Firearms Act of 2004. This followed the consideration of the report of its Committee on Judiciary, human rights and legal matters which recommended that the current fine of 1000 Naira be increased to 5million or Three years imprisonment or both as fine for any person found guilty of importing or in possession of illicit firearms. This legislative intervention is primarily to deter smugglers of firearms and light weapons into Nigeria.
